<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<pre>Although I already have work experience,
my college is forcing me to write
a static and unstyled webpage.
Most of the courses in the curriculum
are easy, boring or impractical
but I am the one who signed
up for this so I guess I can't complain. haha.</pre>
